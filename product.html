                     In the beginning, where there was nothing at all, the world was shrouded by fog. But then came fire, and with fire came disparity, heath and cold
                     life and death, and of course, light and dark. And from the dark, they came, the 4 kings of the darkness. They shattered the primordial soul and 
                     shared each part equally. Thus began the age of fire. But soon, the flame will fade, drowning this world in darkness. One of the kings has to sacrifice
                     himself to revive the flame, but they all refused to do so. You, the chosen undead, have to show that you are worthy to revive the flame by killing all 4
                     kings.

                     Elden square is our latest and biggest project to date, it is set up in a massive open world map. In the unstable country of Lauthrek
                     you can explore the world to research for the secrets scattered all over the world, or go directly for the head of the kings. We wanted 
                     to keep our philosophy of constant challenge, so the game may feel to rough for newcomers, but don't worry, you can seek help at any time
                     by calling a friend of yours to explore and conquere this massive world.
